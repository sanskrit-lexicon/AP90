ap57_90_tooltip_revised.txt contains literary source references for
both ap57 and ap90, based on Cologne digitizations. The
lscount_comp_revised.txt file contains counts of the various
spellings before the changes were made.

This work is done in the context of a project with Thomas to identify
the additions that ap57 made to ap90.

For this purpose, it is useful to 'merge' different spellings of the
same literary source reference. Some lines in  ap57_90_tooltip_revised.txt
are marked 'change to'.  These document that the ap57 digitization was
changed.

The individual changes have not been mentioned in the 'ap_printchange'
file of csl-corrections.
